### Welcome!

I am a recent graduate of the University of Maryland, where I received dual degrees in Neuroscience and Persian Studies, with a Minor in Health, Humanities, & Medicine. 
I am currently a research assistant at the Johns Hopkins Center for OCD, Anxiety, and Related Disorders for Children (COACH), where I am working on projects to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying several neurospychiatric disorders.
